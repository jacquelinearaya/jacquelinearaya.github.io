My name is Jacqueline Araya and I'm a Data Scientist based in London, UK. I recently got my MSc degree in Data Science from Columbia University, and I am widely interested in using data analysis tools, statistical methods and machine learning techniques to support data driven product and services decisions in a variety of business areas. I've worked in applied research related to business and consumer data, with an special interest in marketing and operations management problems. 


Prior to living in New York, I obtained my B.Eng.Sc in Industrial Engineering from Universidad de Chile, where I developed both a strong quantitative skill set and the foundation to understand the different areas of business.
