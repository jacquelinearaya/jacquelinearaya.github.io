# TensorFlow.js: Using a Keras model in the browser to classify 3 popular Columbia Landmarks

Description: This simple website deploys a classifier built with Keras and Tensorflow. Using transfer learning, the classifier is based partly on a well known CNN model, [VGG16](https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/), to learn how to classify accurately any of these 3 popular Columbia University landmarks.
The model predicts the probabilites of any image to be classified as one of the 3 landmarks. Have fun!


This project is based on [this website](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples/tree/master/mobilenet).
